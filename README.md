# Code test - Mortgage plan

I decided to use the Spring framework to build the mortgage calculator application. The application parses the input CSV
file located in the project's root directory at startup and prints the results to the terminal.

Using Spring Web and Thymeleaf, it also hosts a page on localhost port 8080 where all the loaded data can be viewed.
There is also a form to add an estimate to the list.

The application currently does not save the added estimates anywhere but in memory, I hope this is ok.
